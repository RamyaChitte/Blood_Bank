# BLOOD CONNECT

The concept of Blood Donation Database management is useful. Despite advances in 
technology, today's blood bank systems are running in manual system. As such, there is a 
prevalent problem in the availability of needed blood types. For instance, when a person 
needs a certain type of blood and this type is not available in the hospital, family members 
send messages through social media to those who can donate to them and this process takes 
longer than the life of the patient to the most dangerous. In addition, it seems that there is lack 
of proper documentation about blood donors and its medical history. This may lead to blood 
bag contamination and may affect the blood transfusion safety.
The scope of this project is clear to give a simple application to work as well as reduce the 
efforts of storing the database of blood donation.
